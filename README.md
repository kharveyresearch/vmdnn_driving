# vmdnn_driving
Teaching a visuomotor dynamic neural network (VMDNN) how to drive in a 2D car simulator.
Developed using Python 3.6 and PyTorch 0.4.
Loosely based on https://github.com/mulkkyul/p-vmdnn_tensorflow

### How to use
- Download all the code into a directory
- Create 'checkpoints' and 'logs' folders under the same directory
- Run 'main.py'
- Set 'MODE' to 1 for training, 2 for resuming from latest checkpoint, 0 for testing.


## Requirements:
PyTorch
